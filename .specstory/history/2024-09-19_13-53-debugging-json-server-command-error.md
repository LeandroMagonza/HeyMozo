Please help me debug this code. Only debug the latest error.

The latest error in the output suggests that there's an issue with the command being executed in your `server.js` file. The error occurs when trying to run `json-server` with specific options. Let's focus on debugging this part.

The error message indicates that the `--routes` option is unknown. However, the full command seems to include more options that might be causing issues. Here's what we can deduce:

1. The command being executed is:
   ```
   npx json-server --watch db.json --routes routes.json --middlewares ./middleware.js
   ```

2. The `--routes` option is not recognized by the version of `json-server` you're using.

To resolve this issue, try the following:

1. Check your `json-server` version:
   ```
   npx json-server --version
   ```

2. If you're using an older version, update `json-server`:
   ```
   npm install -g json-server@latest
   ```

3. If the issue persists, modify your `server.js` file. The problematic line is likely around line 13. Update it to use the correct options for your `json-server` version. Here's a suggestion:

```javascript:server.js
// ... existing code ...
const result = execSync('npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3000', { encoding: 'utf-8' });
// ... existing code ...
```

This simplified command removes the `--routes` and `--middlewares` options. If you need these features, you may need to configure them differently based on your `json-server` version.

4. If you still need to use routes and middlewares, consider using the JavaScript API of `json-server` instead of the command-line interface. This would involve modifying your `server.js` file more extensively.

After making these changes, try running `npm start` again. If you encounter any more specific errors, please provide the updated error message for further assistance.
